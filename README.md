# Code Minifier Tool (Minify)

## Introduction  
The **Code Minifier Tool** is a lightweight and efficient web-based solution for optimizing your code by removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and redundant syntax. This tool is particularly useful for developers aiming to improve performance, reduce file sizes, and streamline their code for deployment.

## Features  
- **Single-Line and Multi-Line Comment Removal**: Automatically strip out both single-line (`//`) and multi-line (`/* */`) comments from your code.  
- **Whitespace Optimization**: Compresses unnecessary spaces, resulting in compact and clean output.  
- **Simplify Syntax**: Transform redundant constructs like `if (x == true)` into concise forms like `if (x)`.  
- **Variable Name Shortening**: Minimizes variable names for reduced file sizes while maintaining functionality.  
- **Download Options**: Download the minified version of your code directly with just one click.  
- **Clipboard Copy**: Easily copy the minified code to your clipboard.
